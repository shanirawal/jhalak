## 🚀 Backend & Updates

During the hackathon, we developed both the frontend and the backend.  
However, due to some connection/debugging issues, we were only able to deploy the frontend version at submission time.

After the hackathon ended, we resolved the connection issues and deployed the complete working version.

Here are the links:
